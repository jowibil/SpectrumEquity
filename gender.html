                <h1> "Understanding Gender Pay Gaps"</h1>
                <h2> Understanding Why Pay Gaps Between Men and Women Still Exist in the Philippines</h2>
                <hr style="background-color: #53391f; height: 3px;">
                <p>In the Philippines, men and women doing similar jobs often receive different pay. This gap is caused
                    by
                    several factors. One reason is that men are more likely to ask for higher salaries, while women may
                    hold
                    back due to cultural expectations. When women do negotiate, they are sometimes viewed negatively,
                    which
                    can make them less confident about asking for fair pay.

                    Bias in the workplace also plays a role. Employers may favor men when hiring or promoting, even if
                    women
                    have the same skills and experience. Many women also work in jobs like teaching, caregiving, and
                    office
                    support—fields that are often paid less than male-dominated jobs, even if the work is just as
                    demanding.

                    The problem gets worse because salary information is often kept secret, making it hard to see if pay
                    is
                    fair. Also, fewer women are given chances to move into higher positions or leadership roles.

                    To fix this, the government and companies in the Philippines need to support equal pay, make salary
                    systems more transparent, and provide more leadership opportunities for women.</p>

                <h1>"Key Data on the Gender Pay Gap"</h1>
                <h2>Understanding the Persistent Inequities in Earnings in the Philippines</h2>
                <hr style="background-color: #53391f; height: 3px; width: 100%;">
                <p>Nationwide Trends: <span>On average, women in the Philippines earn around 7% to 15% less than men.
                        Despite strong female participation in the workforce, the gender wage gap remains due to
                        occupational segregation and limited access to high-paying roles.</span></p>
                <p>Similar Roles, Unequal Pay: <span>Even when women have comparable jobs, qualifications, and
                        experience,
                        they tend to earn less than their male counterparts. This disparity is often attributed to
                        unconscious bias and gaps in promotion opportunities.</span></p>
                <p>Underrepresentation in Leadership: <span>Women are underrepresented in top executive and
                        decision-making
                        positions. While many women are employed in education, healthcare, and service sectors, men
                        dominate
                        higher-paying industries like construction, engineering, and tech.</span></p>
                <p>Unpaid and Informal Work: <span>A large portion of women’s labor is unpaid, especially in caregiving
                        and
                        household duties. Women are also more likely to be employed in the informal sector, where wages
                        are
                        lower and labor protections are weaker.</span></p>
                <p>COVID-19 Impact: <span>The pandemic intensified gender inequalities. Women were more likely to lose
                        jobs
                        or reduce working hours due to increased care responsibilities at home, particularly during
                        lockdowns and school closures.</span></p>
