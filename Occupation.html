        <h2>
          The Role of Occupational Segregation in the Philippines
        </h2>
        <hr style="background-color: #53391f; height: 3px" />
        <p>
          Traditional gender roles and societal expectations often push men and women into different types of jobs. In
          the
          Philippines, women are mostly found in lower-paying fields like teaching, caregiving, retail, and office work.
          Meanwhile, men are more likely to work in higher-paying jobs such as engineering, IT, and leadership
          positions.
          This job division adds to the gender pay gap and limits women’s chances to earn more and advance in their
          careers.

          Although 41% of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) graduates in the Philippines are women, only
          36.6% get jobs in STEM fields within a year. Challenges like gender bias, lack of support, and family
          responsibilities make it harder for women to enter and stay in these careers.

          To reduce this gap, the country needs better career guidance for young women, more scholarships and training
          in
          STEM, fair hiring practices, and workplace policies that support both women and men equally.

          Multi-faceted approach that begins with challenging long-standing stereotypes about which careers are suitable
          for men or women. Societal norms often discourage women from pursuing roles in fields like engineering,
          technology, or construction, while steering men away from caregiving and teaching positions. To break these
          patterns, it’s important to expand access by providing women with the resources, encouragement, and support
          they
          need to explore non-traditional career paths. This includes offering scholarships, training programs, and
          mentorship opportunities in underrepresented fields. Additionally, employers play a key role by adopting
          inclusive hiring practices that promote diversity and fairness in recruitment, promotion, and workplace
          culture.
          Creating an environment where both women and men can thrive in any profession is essential to closing the
          gender
          gap and achieving true workplace equality.
